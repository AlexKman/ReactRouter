This is a repository I am using to demonstrate and learn about everything that React-Router has to offer

Within this repository I am attempting to replicate the [https://www.twitch.tv/] functionality and layout. Twitch uses a complex routing system however I will be using react router to replicate this as effectively as possible.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Some of the links and resources that I am using

- https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started
- https://reactjs.org/
- https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk
- https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/javascript-implicit-flow
- https://devhints.io/redux
- https://lodash.com/

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
